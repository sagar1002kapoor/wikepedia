            <b>India</b>
            (Hindi: Bhārat), officially the <b>Republic of India</b> (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),
            is a country in South Asia. It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land
            area,
            and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea
            on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;
            China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is
            in
            the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with
            Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
        <p>Modern humanas arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24] Their long
            occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse,
            second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.
            Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago,
            evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.
            By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the
            northwest,[27] unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and
            recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[28][disputed – discuss] The Dravidian languages of India were
            supplanted in the northern and western regions.[29] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had
            emerged within Hinduism,[30] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to
            heredity.[31] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in
            the
            Ganges Basin.[32] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[33] but also marked by the
            declining status of women,[34] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of
            belief.[g][35] In South India, the Middle kingdoms e
            xported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[36]

        </p>
        <p>In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India's
            southern
            and western coasts.
            Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,
            eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of
            medieval Islam.
            In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south
            India.[40]
            In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.
            The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace, leaving a legacy of luminous
            architecture.[h][43] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed,
            turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty British Crown rule began in
            1858.
            The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[45] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas
            of
            education, modernity and the public life took root.[46] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement
            emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.
            In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion
            of
            India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented
            migration.

            India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a
            pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to
            1.211
            billion in 2011.[50] During the same time,
            its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to
            74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[51] India has become a fast-growing major economy
            and
            a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[52] It has a space programme
            which
            includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual
            teachings
            play an increasing role in global culture.[53] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though
            at
            the cost of increasing economic inequality.[54] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in
            military
            expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the
            mid-20th
            century.[55] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[56]
            and
            rising levels of air pollution.
            India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[58] Its forest cover comprises 21.4% of its
            area.[59] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[60] is
            supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats

        <h3>Main article: Names of India</h3>
        <p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the
            Classical
            Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn
            derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian
            Hindush,
            an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river,"
            specifically the Indus river and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.
            The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as "The people of the Indus"
        </p>
        <p>The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] (About this soundlisten)), mentioned in both Indian epic
            poetry
            and the Constitution of India,[64][65] is used in its variations by many Indian languages.
            A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to a region of the
            Gangetic
            Valley,
            Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India
        </p>
        <p>Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (About this soundlisten)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced during the
            Mughal Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day
            northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.

            <dd> By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the
                Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[72][73][74] The earliest known modern
                human
                remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[75] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of
                food
                crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in
                Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[76] These gradually developed into the
                Indus
                Valley Civilisation,[77][76] the first urban culture in South Asia,[78] which flourished during
                2500–1900 BCE in
                what is now Pakistan and western India.[79] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa,
                Dholavira, and
                Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts
                production
                and wide-ranging trade.[78]

                During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from
                the
                Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[80] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with
                Hinduism,[81]
                were composed during this period,[82] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the
                Punjab
                region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[80] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed
                several
                waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[81] The caste system, which
                created
                a
                hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling
                their
                occupations impure, arose during this period.[83] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from
                this
                period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.
                In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments
                dating
                from this period, as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.

                        India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part
                    of the Indo-Australian Plate.[163] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago
                    when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward
                    drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[163]
                    Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the
                    Eurasian Plate.[163] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created
                    the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to
                    uplift the Himalayas.[163] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a
                    vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[164] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic
                    Plain.[165] Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli Range lies the Thar Desert.[166]
